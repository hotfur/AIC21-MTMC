# Evaluation guide

From the instructions of AI City Challenge 2022, you have to output a file (e.g. track1.txt) that follows the required format.

To use this evaluator, you first have to install the dependencies by,

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, you can simply run the following command to get the accuracy results,

> python eval.py <your-output-file> -ds test

For example,

> python eval.py track1.txt -ds test
